# ResultList
Task: Create a resultlist
• Develop an Angular result list with the appended mock data.
• Create an async service, which returns the mocked data (fake API).
• The layout should be responsive or fluid (whatever preference you have)
• Use a mobile first approach (the created scribbles are a general guideline for how it's
supposed to look like)
• Please also implement three filters to sort the tariff list (download/upload speed,
price or any of the tariff attributes)
Notes:
• Please attach the zip version of your angular app on your mail
• If you wrote tests for the JavaScript components please attach them to the project
files
• Use any Angular boilerplate that you evaluate as fitting for the task (Angular-Starter,
Angular-Seed)
• Please invest not more than 3 hours for this task and if you’re not able to finish it,
send us the status quo of what you achieved. It’s not about perfection but more
about the way how you work and what approaches you take.
• Optional: Use SASS to compile the styles and Typescript as weapon of choice
